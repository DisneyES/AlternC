Pre-installation
================

AlternC works well with current or previous stable version of Linux Debian distribution. We are using `apt-get` to install the required softwares.

To install AlternC, you'll need:

* a SSH access to the server.
* administrator rights (`sudo -s` or `su`)
* ensure that `#includedir /etc/sudoers.d` is present in `/etc/sudoers` with the command `visudo`.
