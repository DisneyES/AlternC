alternc (0.9.10pre) stable; urgency=low

  * bugfixes:
    * fix a "already exist" error when creating a database containing an hyphen (-)
    * #1163: fix sqlbackup script call routine to retain backwards
      compatibility
    * fix usage of ISO8859-15 charset (that may NOT be defined in locales...) 
      and add it to the correct url (%%fqdn_lettre%%...)
  * major changes:
    * PHP sessions are now stored in /var/alternc/sessions
  * new features:
    * add support for .cc and .re domains.
    * when creating new accounts, "www, stats, backups" directories are
      automatically created in their accoutn.
    * when adding a new domain to an account, a directory "www/example.net"
      is automatically created and the domain points to it instead of /.
    * add new field to member form: 'notes' which is just a text field
    * send an email on new account creation. the actual email needs to be
      configured through the AlternC variables for this to work.
  * API changes
    * m_mysql->get_db_list() doesn't include size anymore because this
      is a major performance hit on MySQL < 5.1.22 if there are > 1000
      databases on the system. This speeds up the AlternC login by about
      30 seconds on Koumbit.org.
  * Major patch
    * Blue desktop using only css, no frameset etc
    * Sanitizing of get/request/post parameters

alternc (0.9.8) stable; urgency=high

  This release is packed with minor enhancements and bugfixes. It also packages
  security fixes. Not all targets of the milestone were accomplished but this
  was released nevertheless because of the security issue.

  * security:
    * move mysql configuration into a valid MySQL configuration file
      (/etc/alternc/my.cnf). This fixes a serious security issue (#318)
      where the MySQL root password was passed on the commandline and could
      therefore be visible to local users (and hosted members that don't have
      safe_mode controls or can access the process table in some way).
    * disable the autocomplete on frontal user/login
  * various bugfixes
    * upgrade to Debian standard 3.7.3 (from 3.7.2.1)
    * added missing dependency on mysql-client
    * fix display of errors on directory creation
    * from Trac: #1012, #1082, #1077, #1109
    * fix 0.9.7 regressions: #1079, #1080, #1099, #1076
  * new features:
    * starting with this release, the old warning signal defaults to "YES" which
      means that AlternC can be automatically installed without preseeding.
    * crude implementation of a permission change interface in the file browser
      (partial implementation of #267)
    * standardisation of the web interface, along with some esthetic changes, by
      Marc Angles, sponsored by Koumbit (partial implementation of #37)
    * styles can now be changed locally in admin/styles/custom.css
    * allow arbitrary error strings in error handlers
    * copy and archive extraction in the file browser (#1043)
    * display at which time the DNS changes will take effect (#231)
    * use timestamp for sql backups rather than rotating the files (#1063)
    * other simple additions: #1043, #1097

alternc (0.9.3.9-globenet1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major overhaul of configuration and install system:
      - /etc/alternc/alternc.conf is no more and /etc/alternc/local.sh
        is used by everyone else.
      - alternc.install was rewritten.
      - configuration templates now lies in /etc/alternc/templates,
        tagged as conffiles.
      - alternc.install will now check if you have changed a configuration
        file without modifying the template and calling alternc.install
        again.
      - alternc.install now determines which configuration files it needs
        based on what is currently installed, thus it's easier to build
        custom Debian package with lower deps.
  * BIND interaction mostly rewritten:
      - do_domaines.sh is no more and replaced by update_domains.sh
      - templates used to build automatic.conf and zone files are now in
        /etc/bind/templates once installed
      - automatic.conf and slaveip.conf are now generated in /var/alternc/bind
      - zone files are now generated in /var/alternc/bind/zones.
      - the secondary feature and /usr/lib/alternc/bind2 are gone
  * Small things:
      - Striped the second reject_unauth_destination from postfix main.cf.
      - Fixed debconf dependency.
      - Add support for quota on NFS partitions.
      - Disk usage calculation disabled for directories in browser.
      - bind_internal is now used in named.conf template.
      - Fixed phpmyadmin server list bug.
