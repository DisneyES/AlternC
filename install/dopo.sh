# AlternC Language file builder
# THIS SCRIPT MUST BE LAUNCHED EACH TIME A MODULE IS ADDED OR REMOVED FROM ALTERNC
# eg: alternc-procmailbuilder, alternc-mailman ...
# $id$
#
# This script build one "alternc.mo" file per language in /var/alternc/bureau/locales/
# Each alternc.mo file is build with msgfmt from a alternc.po file.
# Each alternc.po file is build from a serie of .po files located in 
# /var/alternc/bureau/locales/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/*.po
# main.txt is included before all others .po to construct a complete alternc.po file.

#  - Advantages : 
#    * allow to add or remove standalone modules to an existing AlternC fluently
#    * only one textdomain is used in all the sources (no need to change it from module to module)
#  - Drawbacks : 
#    * AlternC now requires gettext package to work properly
#    * .mo file must be compiled at each upgrade/install
